# ℤ^d truncated three- and four-point correlations as functions of separations

Concrete `IsingModel.latticeGraph d` statements along `Ambient.cubicExhaustion d`. Under
`Ferromagnetic` on the parameter record, the truncated three-point correlation at a triple
of sites is the anchored three-point function evaluated at the differences of the second
and third sites from the first, and the truncated four-point correlation at a quadruple is
the anchored four-point function at the differences of the second, third and fourth sites
from the first.

Both are proved by translating by the negative of the first site, which sends that site to
the origin and each of the others to its difference from it. No instance argument is taken.

/-- **Three-point correlation depends only on two separations**:
for ferromagnetic `p` and any `i, j, k : Fin d → ℤ`,

`truncated3Infinite ... p i j k = truncated3TwoPoint d p (j - i) (k - i)`.

Proof: apply `truncated3Infinite_latticeGraph_cubicExhaustion_translation`
with `t := -i`, giving `truncated3Infinite ... (-i + i) (-i + j) (-i + k)
= truncated3Infinite ... i j k`. Simplify `-i + i = 0`, `-i + j = j - i`,
`-i + k = k - i`. -/
