# ℤ^d spontaneous correlation: absolute range, and ambient-subgraph monotonicity

The subjects here differ in scope and are kept apart on that account.

At `IsingModel.latticeGraph d` and along an arbitrary `Ambient.Exhaustion` of `Fin d → ℤ`,
the spontaneous correlation of a fixed finite site set is at most `1` in absolute value,
and hence its square is at most `1`. Both assume a non-negative coupling and a positive
inverse temperature, and neither takes an instance argument.

The remaining statement does not mention `latticeGraph d` at all: for two ambient simple
graphs `G₁ ≤ G₂` on the vertex type `Fin d → ℤ`, the spontaneous magnetization at a site
does not decrease when edges are added, again under a non-negative coupling and a positive
inverse temperature. It takes a pair of instance arguments, a stagewise `Fintype` on the
edge sets induced along the exhaustion by each of the two graphs.
