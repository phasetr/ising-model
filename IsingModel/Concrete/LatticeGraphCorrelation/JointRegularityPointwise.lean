# ℤ^d pointwise joint regularity of the finite-volume correlation

Concrete `latticeGraph d` statements that the correlation of a fixed finite set of vertices
of a fixed finite volume, read as a function of the triple `(β, J, h)`, is continuous at an
arbitrary prescribed triple and differentiable over `ℝ` there. Each is stated over the
subgraph induced by that volume and requires a `Fintype` instance on its edge set;
that instance is its entire requirement, since no `Prop`-typed hypothesis is carried here.
