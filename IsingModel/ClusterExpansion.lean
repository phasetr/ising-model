# Cluster (polymer) expansion for the lattice Ising model

This file develops the cluster / polymer expansion that underlies
Glimm–Jaffe §18.4–§18.7, specialised to the lattice Ising model at
zero magnetic field.

The starting point is the FV (3.45) closed form already established
in `IsingModel/Conditioning.lean`:
`Z(J, 0, β) = 2^|ι| · cosh(β·J)^|E| · ∑_{X ⊆ E, even-degree} tanh(β·J)^|X|`.

The cluster expansion organises the sum
`∑_{X ⊆ E, even-degree} tanh(β·J)^|X|`
by decomposing each even subgraph into edge-disjoint connected components
(*polymers*), then expressing `log Z - |ι|·log 2 - |E|·log cosh(β·J)`
as a sum over *clusters* of polymers via the Mayer/Ursell coefficient.

## Main definitions

* `IsEvenSubgraph G X` — `X ⊆ G.edgeFinset` such that every vertex of
  `ι` has an even number of incident edges in `X`. Equivalently, the
  cycle space of the underlying graph (over `F_2`).

## Main results

* `IsEvenSubgraph.empty` — the empty edge set is an even subgraph.
* `IsEvenSubgraph.symmDiff` — the symmetric difference of two even
  subgraphs is an even subgraph (cycle space is closed under XOR).
* `isEvenSubgraph_iff` — characterises the even-subgraph predicate as
  the sum-form used by `partitionFunction_high_temp_expansion_h_zero_closed`.

vertex has an even number of incident edges in `X`. The set of even
subgraphs is the cycle space of `G` (over `F_2`); it is the natural
domain for the FV (3.45) sum
`∑_{X ⊆ E, even-degree} tanh(β·J)^|X|`. -/
