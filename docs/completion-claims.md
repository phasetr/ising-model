# Completion-claim evidence gate

The phase-1 gate validates a pull request's declared evidence against a small,
trusted, offline context snapshot. It does not query GitHub, inspect the local
repository, run commands, read credentials, or decide whether a mathematical or
historical statement is true.

`PASS` means only that the structured fields agree with the supplied context.
It is not a semantic completion verdict. Every semantic claim and every
semantic claim level is reported as `HUMAN_REVIEW_REQUIRED`.

## Inputs

Invoke the checker with two explicit UTF-8 files:

```text
python3 scripts/completion_claim_gate.py --context context.json --body body.md
```

The context has this exact schema:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "is_draft": true,
  "delivery": "pull_request",
  "base_sha": "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
  "head_sha": "1111111111111111111111111111111111111111",
  "changed_paths": ["repo/relative/path"],
  "allowed_issue_refs": [4796, 4801]
}
```

The caller is responsible for constructing that trusted snapshot. Phase 1 has
no live workflow, API client, ruleset integration, authentication, or mirror
gate.

## Managed block

The body must contain exactly one fenced `completion-claims-v1` JSON block.
Unknown or missing keys, duplicate JSON keys, duplicate blocks, malformed
types, and unsupported schema versions fail closed.

```completion-claims-v1
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "candidate": {
    "base_sha": "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",

    },
    {
      "kind": "issue_resolution_audit",
      "head_sha": "1111111111111111111111111111111111111111",
      "url": "https://github.com/example/project/issues/4801#issuecomment-2"
    }
  ],
  "references": {
    "non_closing": ["Refs #4801", "Part of #4796"],
    "closing": []
  },
  "semantic_claims": [
    {
      "id": "stable-local-id",
      "kind": "source",
      "statement": "The cited source supports the stated role.",
      "evidence_urls": ["https://example.test/source"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Candidate identity

Both SHAs must be full lowercase 40-character hexadecimal values. The base SHA,
head SHA, changed-file count, and path digest must agree exactly with the
context. Review records of both kinds are required and must record that same
head SHA.

Changed paths are nonempty, unique, repository-relative UTF-8 strings. Empty
paths, absolute paths, parent traversal, newlines, NULs, backslashes, and
duplicates are rejected. There are no path exemptions, including for
`.self-local/reports/*.lean`.

To compute `sorted_path_digest`, encode every path as UTF-8, sort by those bytes,
and hash each path in sequence as:

```text
<decimal byte length>:<path bytes>
```

The result is written as `sha256:` followed by 64 lowercase hexadecimal
characters. Length framing prevents concatenation ambiguity.

### Claim and review boundary

Allowed claim levels are:

- `build_health`
- `source_axiom_health`
- `exact_candidate_diff`
- `bounded_tracker_completion`
- `theorem_api_contract`
- `repository_wide_completion`

The list must be nonempty and duplicate-free. The checker validates the enum;
it does not certify that a selected level is honest.
`bounded_tracker_completion`, `theorem_api_contract`, and
`repository_wide_completion` always emit `HUMAN_REVIEW_REQUIRED`.

Review records must contain exactly the `source_review` and
`issue_resolution_audit` kinds, durable HTTPS URL syntax, and the exact
candidate head. URL relevance, reviewer independence, authorship, source role,
theorem meaning, and historical or provenance prose remain human decisions.

Semantic claim kinds are `source`, `theorem`, and `provenance`. Every semantic
claim emits `HUMAN_REVIEW_REQUIRED`; a semantic result is never reported as
`PASS`.

### Issue references

`references.closing` is mandatory and must be empty. The body is also rejected
if it contains a GitHub auto-close keyword followed by an issue number,
including when prose negates the keyword. The only structured non-closing forms
are `Refs #NUMBER` and `Part of #NUMBER`, and their numbers must be in
`allowed_issue_refs`.

## Draft and ready behavior

Draft bodies may use the literal string `PENDING` for candidate fields, review
record SHAs or URLs, and semantic evidence URLs. Missing review kinds are also
allowed in a draft. With no deterministic contradiction, these produce
`DRAFT_INCOMPLETE` and exit 2.

A deterministic contradiction produces `FAIL` and exit 1 in both draft and
ready states. A ready body rejects every `PENDING` value and requires both
exact-head review records. When all deterministic checks succeed, the machine
status is `PASS` and the process exits 0; any accompanying semantic records
still say `HUMAN_REVIEW_REQUIRED`.

## Self-test

Run:

```text
python3 scripts/test_completion_claim_gate.py
```

The suite includes baseline and incident-derived fixtures for #4709, #4718,
and PR #4800. It mutates SHAs, paths, counts, digests, references, review heads,
delivery, blocks, keys, and ready placeholders. It also kills representative
weakened-checker mutants, pins `.self-local` path coverage, and verifies that
the checker imports no process, network, or dynamic-execution facility.
